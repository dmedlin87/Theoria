## Changes

<!-- Describe what architectural patterns you're implementing -->

- [ ] Added DTOs for domain: _______________
- [ ] Created repository interface for: _______________
- [ ] Implemented SQLAlchemy repository for: _______________
- [ ] Updated routes to use repositories
- [ ] Added domain error handling
- [ ] Added query optimizations
- [ ] Added API versioning

## Before & After

### Before (Old Pattern)
```python
# Paste old code here
```

### After (New Pattern)
```python
# Paste new code here
```

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added (with mocks)
- [ ] Integration tests added (with database)
- [ ] Architecture tests updated
- [ ] All tests passing

## Performance Impact

- Query time: Before ___ ms → After ___ ms
- Memory usage: Before ___ MB → After ___ MB
- N+1 queries eliminated: ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A

## Backward Compatibility

- [ ] Existing routes still work
- [ ] No breaking API changes
- [ ] Database migrations backward compatible
- [ ] Feature flags used (if needed)

## Checklist

- [ ] Followed patterns in `docs/architecture/improvements.md`
- [ ] DTOs are frozen dataclasses
- [ ] Repositories use dependency injection
- [ ] Domain errors used instead of HTTPException
- [ ] No ORM models in service layer
- [ ] Added tests for new code
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Ran architecture boundary tests
