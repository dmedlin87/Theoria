## 🚀 Quick Start for Your Agents

### Step 1: Read Documentation
1. Start with `QUICK_START_FOR_AGENTS.md` (immediate action plan)
2. Reference `IMPLEMENTATION_CONTEXT.md` (patterns and conventions)
3. Check `HANDOFF_SESSION_2025_10_15.md` (current state)

### Step 2: Set Up Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start services
.\start-theoria.ps1

# Verify scheduler is running
# Check logs for: "Discovery scheduler started successfully"
```

### Step 3: Implement Gap Analysis
Follow the complete implementation in `QUICK_START_FOR_AGENTS.md`:
1. Create `theo/domain/discoveries/gap_engine.py`
2. Create `data/seeds/theological_topics.yaml`
3. Write tests in `tests/domain/discoveries/test_gap_engine.py`
4. Integrate into `DiscoveryService`
5. Add `bertopic>=0.15,<1` to `requirements.txt`
6. Export from `theo/domain/discoveries/__init__.py`

### Step 4: Test
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/domain/discoveries/test_gap_engine.py -v

# Integration tests
pytest tests/api/test_discovery_integration.py -v

# Manual test
curl http://localhost:8000/api/discoveries?type=gap
```

### Step 5: Continue with Next Discovery Type
Repeat pattern for Connection, Trend, and Anomaly detection.

## 💡 Tips for Your Agents

### Pattern to Follow
Look at `theo/domain/discoveries/contradiction_engine.py` - it's the best example because it was just implemented. Copy its structure:

1. **Dataclass for discovery result** (frozen=True)
2. **Engine class with __init__ for config**
3. **Lazy loading for expensive resources** (_load_model pattern)
4. **detect() method that returns list of discoveries**
5. **Helper methods prefixed with _**
6. **Comprehensive docstrings**
7. **Type hints everywhere**

### Common Patterns
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward refs
- Lazy load ML models to avoid startup delays
- Batch process large datasets
- Use context managers for database sessions
- Return empty list for insufficient data (don't error)
- Sort by confidence (highest first)
- Limit results to top N (avoid overwhelming users)

### Testing Strategy
- Test initialization
- Test with valid input
- Test with edge cases (empty, too few, invalid)
- Test with realistic data
- Mark slow tests with `@pytest.mark.slow`
- Use fixtures for test data

## 📞 Support

All context is in the documentation. If agents need clarification:

1. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_CONTEXT.md` for patterns
2. Look at existing engines for examples
3. Review `docs/DISCOVERY_FEATURE.md` for requirements
4. Examine tests for expected behavior
