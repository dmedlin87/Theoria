2. **CONTRIBUTING Updates:** Reference `docs/INDEX.md` for documentation guidelines
3. **Archive Review:** Periodically review archive for documents that can be removed entirely
4. **Documentation Health:** Set up quarterly reviews to keep canonical docs current
5. **Link Validation:** Run link checker to find any broken references post-move

## Validation

To verify the cleanup:

```powershell
# Check root directory is clean
Get-ChildItem *.md | Select-Object Name

# Verify archive structure
Get-ChildItem docs\archive\ -Recurse -Directory

# Check branding updates
Select-String -Path docs\*.md -Pattern "Theo Engine|TheoEngine" | Where-Object { $_.Path -notmatch "archive" }

# Count archived files
(Get-ChildItem docs\archive\ -Recurse -File).Count
```
