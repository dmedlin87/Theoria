## 📋 Context

### What Was Discussed

User wanted killer features that would make Theoria indispensable for theological research. Specifically focused on:

1. **Auto-discovery features** - The original reason for building Theoria
2. **"Lazy exploration" mode** - Automatic insights without manual searching
3. **Handling large corpus growth** - Planning to dump video transcripts, AI research, etc.
4. **Automated discoveries alongside focused research** - Two modes: Hunter (search) + Explorer (discover)

### Key User Quote
> "I was wanting a super targeted focused search like we have but I also want a lazy day 'auto find' type of thing. I'm hoping there is just a ton of automated discoveries along the way as well as focused research work."

## 🤖 ML Strategy (Answered User's Question)

### Should We Use ML/Deep Learning?

**Answer**: Yes, strategically.

#### ✅ Use ML For (High ROI):
1. **Embeddings** - Already using pgvector! Leverage for clustering
2. **Clustering** - DBSCAN/KMeans for pattern detection
3. **Classification** - Theological stance detection (Reformed, Catholic, etc.)
4. **NLI** - Natural Language Inference for contradiction detection
5. **Topic Modeling** - BERTopic or LDA for theme extraction
6. **Similarity** - Document/passage similarity for connections

#### ⚠️ Maybe (Medium ROI):
- Trend forecasting
- Personalized recommendations
- Learning user preferences

#### ❌ Avoid (Overkill):
- Deep learning from scratch
- Custom LLMs (use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs)
- Complex neural networks (start simple, scale up)

#### Recommended Tech Stack
```python
# Core ML
scikit-learn              # Clustering, stats
sentence-transformers     # Embeddings (already using!)
transformers              # Pre-trained models

# Optional Advanced
bertopic                  # Modern topic modeling
spacy                     # NER for theological terms
flair                     # Few-shot classification
```

### Key Insight
**Don't build what you can buy/use.** Leverage:
- Existing pgvector embeddings
- Pre-trained transformers models
- OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for generation
- Start simple (scikit-learn), scale up only if needed

## 🚀 How to Continue

### For Next Developer/AI Agent

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Start with `docs/DISCOVERY_QUICK_START.md`
   - Read `docs/DISCOVERY_FEATURE.md` for architecture
   - Check `docs/FUTURE_FEATURES_ROADMAP.md` for vision

2. **Test Current Implementation**
   ```powershell
   .\start-theoria.ps1
   # Navigate to http://localhost:3000/discoveries
   ```

3. **Implement Backend (Priority Order)**
   
   **Step 1**: Database
   ```sql
   -- Run migration
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add discoveries table"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

   **Step 2**: FastAPI Endpoints
   ```python
   # Create theo/services/api/app/routers/discoveries.py
   # Implement GET, POST, DELETE handlers
   ```

   **Step 3**: Pattern Detection (Simplest ML)
   ```python
   # Use existing embeddings + DBSCAN
   from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
   import numpy as np
   
   async def detect_patterns(user_id: str):
       # Get embeddings from documents
       # Cluster with DBSCAN
       # Generate pattern discoveries
       pass
   ```

   **Step 4**: Connect Frontend to Backend
   ```typescript
   // Update theo/services/web/app/api/discoveries/route.ts
   // Replace mock data with fetch to FastAPI
   const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL;
   const response = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/api/discoveries`);
   ```

   **Step 5**: Background Jobs
   ```python
   # Add Celery task or APScheduler job
   # Trigger after document upload
   # Schedule nightly analysis
   ```

4. **Add More Discovery Types**
   - Contradiction: Use NLI model
   - Gap: Topic distribution stats
   - Connection: Verse cross-reference finder
   - Trend: Query history analysis
   - Anomaly: Statistical outliers

5. **Iterate Based on User Feedback**
   - Track which discoveries get clicked
   - Monitor helpful/not helpful ratio
   - Adjust confidence thresholds
   - Refine ML models

---

## 💡 Key Insights from Conversation

### User's Vision
Theoria should work in **two modes**:

| **Hunter Mode** 🎯 | **Explorer Mode** 🔍 |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| I know what I want | Show me something interesting |
| Search-driven | Discovery-driven |
| Focused, precise | Serendipitous, browsing |
| Bottom-up (data → insight) | Top-down (insights → data) |

**Discovery Feed is Explorer Mode.**

### Design Philosophy
1. **Proactive, not reactive** - System works in background
2. **Surfacing connections** - Show what user wouldn't find manually
3. **Lazy exploration** - Perfect for Sunday afternoon browsing
4. **Learning system** - Feedback improves recommendations
5. **Trust through transparency** - Show confidence scores, explain why

### Success Criteria
- User logs in → sees interesting insights immediately
- Discovers connections they wouldn't have found
- Reduces research friction
- Makes corpus "come alive"
- Becomes indispensable for daily theological work

---

## 📞 Questions to Ask User (Next Session)

1. **Discovery Preferences**
   - Which discovery types are most valuable?
   - How often should we run analysis? (real-time vs nightly)
   - Email notifications or just in-app?

2. **Feature Priorities**
   - From roadmap, which 3 features to build first?
   - Dashboard or Collections more urgent?
   - Citation manager timing?

3. **ML Tolerance**
   - Acceptable false positive rate?
   - Minimum confidence threshold? (show 70%+ or 80%+?)
   - Privacy concerns with AI analysis?

4. **Integration Needs**
   - Export to specific tools? (Logos, Zotero, etc.)
   - API access for external tools?
   - Webhooks for automation?

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Known Limitations (Current)
- Mock data only (static 6 discoveries)
- No persistence (feedback/dismissals don't save)
- No user-specific data (same for everyone)
- No actual corpus analysis

**These are expected** - frontend is demo-ready, waiting for backend.

### Don't Repeat These Mistakes
1. ❌ Don't build ML from scratch - use pre-trained
2. ❌ Don't over-engineer - start simple
3. ❌ Don't ignore feedback - it trains the system
4. ❌ Don't skip confidence scores - users need to trust

### Quick Wins Available
1. ✅ Implement database schema (1 hour)
2. ✅ Basic GET endpoint returning empty array (30 min)
3. ✅ Connect frontend to real API (30 min)
4. ✅ Simple pattern detection with existing embeddings (2-3 hours)

---

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

Once live, measure:

1. **Adoption**: % of users who visit /discoveries
2. **Engagement**: Avg discoveries viewed per session
3. **Click-through**: % of discoveries explored
4. **Feedback ratio**: Helpful vs not helpful
5. **Accuracy**: Confidence score vs user reaction
6. **Retention**: Do users come back daily?
7. **Discovery quality**: False positive rate
8. **Time to insight**: How fast do users find value?

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

**What we built**: A production-ready, beautifully designed Discovery Feed frontend that demonstrates the "lazy exploration" concept with 6 discovery types, filtering, feedback, and smart navigation.

**What it needs**: Backend implementation to make discoveries dynamic and real-time based on actual corpus analysis.

**Why it matters**: Transforms Theoria from a search tool into an **intelligent research companion** that proactively surfaces insights, making theological research effortless and delightful.

**Next session focus**: Backend implementation → Database + FastAPI + Pattern detection → Go live with real discoveries!
