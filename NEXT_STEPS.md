## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Pick One)

### Option 1: Stand Up Hypothesis Backbone ⭐⭐⭐ Recommended First
**Task**: TASK_CS_001 (2-3 days)
```bash
# Run backend tests focused on research service
pytest theo/services/api/tests/research/test_hypotheses.py -k "not slow"

# Validate Next.js dashboard builds
cd theo/services/web && npm run lint && npm run test -- --runTestsByPath tests/app/research/hypotheses-dashboard.test.tsx
```
**Why**: Hypothesis persistence + dashboard are prerequisites for every other Cognitive Scholar feature.

---

### Option 2: Activate Cognitive Gate ⭐⭐⭐ High Value
**Task**: TASK_CS_002 (3-4 days)

**What**: Introduce the gating heuristics that sit in front of high-cost reasoning workflows.

**Benefits**:
- Protects LLM spend by rejecting low-rigor generations.
- Emits telemetry for tuning and alerting.
- Unlocks Debate v0 and multi-loop autonomy experiments.

**Files**: See `docs/tasks/TASK_CS_002_Wire_Cognitive_Gate_v0.md`

---

### Option 3: Pilot Debate v0 ⭐⭐ Aspirational
**Task**: TASK_CS_003 (4-5 days)

**What**: Run a two-perspective debate with a judge verdict and push the result into the hypothesis dashboard.

**Benefits**:
- Demonstrates the full Cognitive Scholar loop for stakeholders.
- Exercises Cognitive Gate + Hypothesis pipeline end-to-end.
- Establishes UI/UX patterns for transcripts and verdicts.

**Files**: See `docs/tasks/TASK_CS_003_Ship_Debate_v0.md`

---

## 📚 Task Documentation

Cognitive Scholar tasks now live in `docs/tasks/`:

- **TASK_CS_001** – Implement Hypothesis Object & Dashboard (2-3 days, HIGH)
- **TASK_CS_002** – Wire Cognitive Gate v0 (3-4 days, HIGH)
- **TASK_CS_003** – Ship Debate v0 (4-5 days, MEDIUM-HIGH)

Each document includes:
- Objectives + acceptance criteria
- Target files/components across Python + TypeScript
- Testing + telemetry expectations
- Follow-up ideas for Alpha/Beta scope

## 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1: Cognitive Scholar MVP Foundations (Week 1-2)
1. 🚧 Ship **TASK_CS_001** (Hypothesis Object & Dashboard).
2. 🚧 Enable hypothesis analytics + instrumentation hooks.
3. 🚧 Document data contracts for downstream agents.

### Phase 2: Guardrails & Autonomy (Week 3-4)
1. 🚧 Complete **TASK_CS_002** (Cognitive Gate v0).
2. 🚧 Wire gate verdicts into orchestrator events + logging.
3. 🚧 Tune gate thresholds using sandbox transcripts.

### Phase 3: Debate & Perspective Surfacing (Week 5-6)
1. 🚧 Launch **TASK_CS_003** (Debate v0) with skeptical/apologetic defaults.
2. 🚧 Update dashboard to display debate verdict deltas.
3. 🚧 Gather user feedback + capture follow-up tasks for Debate v1.

### Phase 4: Alpha Enhancements (Beyond MVP)
1. 🔭 Truth-Maintenance Graph + belief updates.
2. 🔭 Multi-hypothesis runner + perspective toggles.
3. 🔭 Insights panel + contradiction finder upgrades.

### For New Patterns
- **Quick Start**: `QUICK_START_ARCHITECTURE.md` (5 min)
- **Examples**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md`
- **Full Guide**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### For Reference
- **Clean Routes**: `theo/services/api/app/routes/discoveries_v1.py`
- **Use Case Pattern**: `theo/services/api/app/use_cases/refresh_discoveries.py`
- **Repository Tests**: `tests/application/repositories/test_discovery_repository.py`

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
- **ORM Leakage**: Currently ~15 violations → Target: 0
- **Query Performance**: Currently mixed → Target: <100ms p95
- **Test Speed**: Some slow → Target: <1s for unit tests
- **Coverage**: Good → Target: >85% for new code

### Process Metrics
- **Time to add feature**: Currently varies → Target: <4h with patterns
- **Breaking changes**: Currently 3/quarter → Target: 0 (use versioning)
- **Bug escape rate**: Track → Target: <5%

---

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### When Adding New Code
✅ **DO**:
- Use DTOs instead of ORM models
- Access data via repositories
- Raise domain errors for failures
- Add eager loading for relationships
- Write tests with mocks first

❌ **DON'T**:
- Import from `theo.adapters.persistence.models` in services
- Query database directly in routes
- Return different error formats
- Forget to run architecture tests

### Before Committing
```bash
# Run checks
pytest tests/architecture/ -v
pytest tests/application/ -v
mypy theo/
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Prototype a thin slice of TASK_CS_001 (e.g., repository + list API) before expanding scope.
2. **Use References**: Reuse patterns from `theo/services/api/app/routes/discoveries_v1.py` and existing research tests.
3. **Test First**: Capture repository + API expectations in `theo/services/api/tests/research/test_hypotheses.py` before wiring UI.
4. **Ask for Help**: Architectural patterns remain documented—cross-check `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.
5. **Document Lessons**: Add Cognitive Scholar insights to `docs/tasks/theoria_feature_brainstorm_cognitive_scholar_v_1.md`.
