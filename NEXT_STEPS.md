---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Pick One)

### Option 1: Validate Everything Works ⭐ Recommended First
**Task**: TASK_004 (30 minutes)
```bash
# Run architecture tests
pytest tests/architecture/ -v

# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Check coverage
pytest --cov=theo --cov-report=html
```
**Why**: Establish baseline before making changes

---

### Option 2: Demonstrate Migration Pattern ⭐⭐⭐ High Value
**Task**: TASK_001 (2-3 hours)

**What**: Migrate `DiscoveryService` to use new repository pattern

**Benefits**:
- Validates entire architecture stack works in production
- Creates migration template for team
- Improves testability (can mock repositories)

**Files**: See `docs/tasks/TASK_001_Migrate_DiscoveryService.md`

---

### Option 3: Build Next Feature with Clean Architecture ⭐⭐⭐
**Task**: TASK_002 (3-4 hours)

**What**: Implement Gap Analysis Engine with BERTopic

**Benefits**:
- Advances discovery feature roadmap
- Demonstrates building new features with clean patterns
- Pure domain logic from day 1

**Files**: See `docs/tasks/TASK_002_Implement_Gap_Analysis_Engine.md`

---

### Option 4: Quick Performance Wins ⭐⭐
**Task**: TASK_003 (1-2 hours)

**What**: Add eager loading to search/document endpoints

**Benefits**:
- Immediate user-facing improvements
- Low risk, high reward
- Validates query optimization tools

**Files**: See `docs/tasks/TASK_003_Add_Query_Optimizations.md`

---

## 📚 Task Documentation

All tasks have detailed handoff documents in `docs/tasks/`:

- **TASK_001**: Migrate DiscoveryService (2-3h, HIGH priority)
- **TASK_002**: Implement Gap Analysis (3-4h, HIGH priority)
- **TASK_003**: Query Optimizations (1-2h, MEDIUM priority)
- **TASK_004**: Validate Architecture (30m, validation)

Each document includes:
- Clear objectives
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Code examples
- Testing strategy
- Success criteria
- Common pitfalls

---

## 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap

### Phase 1: Validation & Migration (This Week)
1. ✅ Run TASK_004 to validate baseline
2. ✅ Complete TASK_001 to demonstrate migration
3. ✅ Document lessons learned

### Phase 2: Feature Development (Next 2 Weeks)
1. ✅ Implement TASK_002 (Gap Analysis)
2. ✅ Add remaining discovery engines (Connection, Trend, Anomaly)
3. ✅ Apply TASK_003 optimizations

### Phase 3: Gradual Service Migration (Month 1-2)
1. ✅ Migrate DocumentService to repositories
2. ✅ Migrate SearchService with optimizations
3. ✅ Create v2.0 endpoints with improved contracts

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Month 3+)
1. ✅ Add Redis caching layer
2. ✅ Implement read replicas
3. ✅ Migrate to Celery for distributed jobs
4. ✅ Add distributed tracing

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### For New Patterns
- **Quick Start**: `QUICK_START_ARCHITECTURE.md` (5 min)
- **Examples**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md`
- **Full Guide**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### For Reference
- **Clean Routes**: `theo/services/api/app/routes/discoveries_v1.py`
- **Use Case Pattern**: `theo/services/api/app/use_cases/refresh_discoveries.py`
- **Repository Tests**: `tests/application/repositories/test_discovery_repository.py`

---

## 📊 Success Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
- **ORM Leakage**: Currently ~15 violations → Target: 0
- **Query Performance**: Currently mixed → Target: <100ms p95
- **Test Speed**: Some slow → Target: <1s for unit tests
- **Coverage**: Good → Target: >85% for new code

### Process Metrics
- **Time to add feature**: Currently varies → Target: <4h with patterns
- **Breaking changes**: Currently 3/quarter → Target: 0 (use versioning)
- **Bug escape rate**: Track → Target: <5%

---

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### When Adding New Code
✅ **DO**:
- Use DTOs instead of ORM models
- Access data via repositories
- Raise domain errors for failures
- Add eager loading for relationships
- Write tests with mocks first

❌ **DON'T**:
- Import from `theo.adapters.persistence.models` in services
- Query database directly in routes
- Return different error formats
- Forget to run architecture tests

### Before Committing
```bash
# Run checks
pytest tests/architecture/ -v
pytest tests/application/ -v
mypy theo/
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Pick TASK_004 or TASK_003 to build confidence
2. **Use References**: Copy patterns from `discoveries_v1.py`
3. **Test First**: Write repository mocks before implementation
4. **Ask for Help**: All patterns are documented with examples
5. **Document Lessons**: Add insights to migration guide
