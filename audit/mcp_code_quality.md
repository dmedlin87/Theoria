# MCP Code Quality Analysis

Date: 2025-10-09 17:19 UTC

## Summary
- Static analysis with `ruff` reports no lint issues across the `mcp_server` package.
- Targeted `pytest` suite for MCP tools passes, confirming runtime behavior of read/write handlers and metadata endpoints.
- Type-checking via `mypy` requires broader TheoEngine API annotations; current dependency chain prevents isolating MCP modules without encountering pre-existing type stub gaps.

## Commands Executed

```bash
ruff check mcp_server
```
Result: ✅ No findings.

```bash
pytest tests/mcp_tools -q
```
Result: ✅ 16 passed (with 1 third-party deprecation warning).

```bash
mypy --config-file=/tmp/mypy_mcp.ini mcp_server
```
Result: ⚠️ Blocked by missing typing information in imported TheoEngine modules (e.g., `pythonbible` stubs) and existing annotation debt.

## Follow-Up Recommendations
- Introduce dedicated mypy configuration for MCP server that mocks or isolates dependencies on `theo.services.api` to enable clean type-checking.
- Explore installing `types-pythonbible` or adding `py.typed` markers upstream to resolve stub gaps once available.
- Continue running the MCP test suite in CI to guard regressions as additional tools are implemented.
