## Document Organization Principles

1. **Root-level onboarding** â€“ Product overview, launch instructions, and agent handoffs
2. **docs/** â€“ Active specifications, guides, and reference material organized by directory
3. **docs/adr/** â€“ Architecture Decision Records (permanent commitments)
4. **docs/status/** â€“ Governance indexes for feature docs and bug ledgers
5. **docs/runbooks/** & **docs/process/** â€“ Operational playbooks and retrospectives
6. **docs/testing/** & **docs/dashboards/** â€“ Quality strategies and observability assets
7. **docs/archive/** â€“ Historical documentation (not actively maintained)

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. **Keep canonical docs current** - Update authoritative references first
2. **Use clear titles** - Enable easy navigation and search
3. **Cross-reference** - Link related documents
4. **Archive obsolete docs** - Move completed session notes to `docs/archive/`
5. **Update this index** - Keep INDEX.md synchronized with new additions
