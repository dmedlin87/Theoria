# Archive: October 26, 2025 - Root Documentation Cleanup

> **Archived on:** October 26, 2025  
> **Reason:** Root directory cleanup - moving completed work and temporary files to maintain clean project structure

## What's in this archive

This folder contains documentation that was moved from the repository root during the October 26, 2025 cleanup:

### Completed Architecture Work
- `ARCHITECTURE_PHASE2_PROGRESS.md` - Progress tracking document (work completed)
- `ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md` - Architecture completion summary

- `temp_patch.txt` - Code patch file

### Duplicate/Superseded Documentation

## Why these were archived

- **Architecture documents**: Work is complete, implementation is done, these are historical records
- **Test files**: Should be in proper test directories, not at root level
- **Temporary files**: Development artifacts that should be cleaned up
- **Cleanup summaries**: Previous cleanup work documentation, now superseded
