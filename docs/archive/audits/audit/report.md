# Theoria Code Audit Report

## Executive Summary

Re-testing the ten issues cited in the previous audit confirmed that each defect has been corrected in the current codebase. Copilot workflows now initialise their mode context correctly, quick-start presets and sermon renders guard optional data, citation exports accept optional sources, guardrail helpers import their dependencies, and ingestion endpoints perform strict sanitisation, streaming, and URL allow-listing. No reproducible defects or security weaknesses from the original report remain, so there are presently no outstanding corrective actions at this severity level.

## Findings by Subsystem

### Frontend / Next.js

All previously logged Copilot findings (FE1–FE4) have been validated as fixed; no new issues were discovered during re-verification.

### API / FastAPI

Citation export, guardrail profile handling, and request schema aliasing are operating as expected. There are no open API findings from the prior report.

### Workers / Celery

– Needs Human Review — No worker-specific code paths were exercised in this pass; please review retry/idempotency manually.

### DB / Models

– Needs Human Review — No schema-level issues observed during this slice; confirm migrations/indexes align with queries.

### Search / Indexing

– Needs Human Review — Vector/BM25 configuration not assessed in this pass.

### OSIS Utilities

– Needs Human Review — OSIS parsing & expansion logic not exercised; targeted tests recommended.

### Ingestion / Transcripts

File, transcript, and URL ingestion hardening (path sanitisation, streaming uploads, and URL allow-listing) is in place. No unresolved ingestion findings remain.

## Quick Wins (≤ 1 hour)

No remaining quick wins. The previously identified guardrail import, citation export schema, and filename sanitisation tasks are already complete upstream.

## Stability First (Critical Correctness)

No stability blockers remain from the prior audit; continue monitoring new feature work to ensure regressions do not reintroduce the resolved issues.
