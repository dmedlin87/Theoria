# Theoria - Next Phase Development Plan

> **Status:** Ready for implementation
> **Last Updated:** 2025-02-10
> **Estimated Timeline:** 6â€“8 weeks

---

## Executive Summary

The next delivery window advances the **Cognitive Scholar** initiative: durable hypothesis objects, gate-managed reasoning, and
structured debate workflows. The plan is organized around successive capability layersâ€”gate, loop control, thought management,
debate orchestration, and prompt governance. Each phase concludes with demos and telemetry hooks to keep research UX and safety
in lockstep.

### Current State âœ…
- âœ… Frontend scaffolding for `/research/hypotheses`
- âœ… Prompt kernel prototypes for the Cognitive Gate
- âœ… Baseline Prompt-Observe-Update loop in production
- âœ… Reasoning telemetry primitives (trails, fallacy reports)
- âœ… Documentation and safety guardrails for agents

### What's Next ðŸŽ¯
1. Productionize Cognitive Gate v0 and ship hypothesis objects.
2. Swap the Prompt-Observe-Update loop to be gate-aware and log all outcomes.
3. Launch Thought Management System (TMS) v0 with persistence and admin tooling.
4. Orchestrate Debate Loop v0 and wire structured visualizations.
5. Deliver Meta-Prompt picker and finalize Beta readiness hardening.

## Phase 1 (Week 1â€“2): Hypothesis Objects & Cognitive Gate v0

### Goals
- Persist research hypotheses with lifecycle metadata and evidence hooks.
- Stand up the Cognitive Gate service for admission control and policy enforcement.

### Tasks
- **Hypothesis Schema & Storage**
  - Create migrations for `hypotheses`, `hypothesis_evidence`, and linking tables.
  - Implement repository/service layer APIs for CRUD and status transitions.
  - Backfill tests covering optimistic concurrency and soft-deletes.
- **Cognitive Gate Service v0**
  - Convert the prompt kernel into `theo/services/api/app/ai/gate/service.py`.
  - Implement score computation, policy thresholds, and audit logging.
  - Expose `/api/ai/gate/evaluate` endpoint with contract tests.
- **Integration & Telemetry**
  - Wire gate decisions into research/chat flows in `GuardedAnswerPipeline`.
  - Emit structured telemetry (scores, policy, overrides) to metrics stream.
  - Document gate operations, fail-open criteria, and override workflow in `docs/AGENT_AND_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md`.

## Phase 2 (Week 3): POU Loop Swap & Research UI Refresh

### Goals
- Replace legacy evaluator with gate-managed control logic.
- Expose hypotheses and gate results in the research UI.

### Tasks
- **POU Loop Swap**
  - Update `GuardedAnswerPipeline` to delegate to the Cognitive Gate.
  - Add fallback handling for gate errors (retry, degrade, operator alert).
  - Expand unit and integration tests to cover pass, reject, and override paths.
- **UI & API Updates**
  - Enhance `/research/hypotheses` page to display gate verdicts, scores, and timestamps.
  - Extend research API responses with hypothesis IDs and gate metadata.
  - Update docs and demos illustrating hypothesis creation and review flows.

## Phase 3 (Weeks 4â€“5): Thought Management System (TMS) v0

### Goals
- Manage concurrent hypotheses, branching, and archival through a dedicated service.
- Provide operators with tooling to inspect and replay thought sequences.

### Tasks
- **TMS Service Layer**
  - Implement `theo/services/api/app/ai/tms/service.py` with session lifecycle management.
  - Persist step history including prompt, agent, gate verdict, and outcome.
  - Create retention policy jobs for pruning inactive sessions.
- **Admin & Observability**
  - Build admin UI for TMS inspection (filter by hypothesis, gate verdict, outcome).
  - Add replay endpoint to re-run or audit sessions under new policies.
  - Instrument metrics for session duration, branch counts, and overrides.

## Phase 4 (Weeks 6): Debate Loop v0 & Visualization Layer v1

### Goals
- Introduce orchestrated pro/con agents moderated by the Cognitive Gate.
- Visualize debates and hypothesis evolution in the research UI.

### Tasks
- **Debate Orchestration**
  - Implement debate coordinator managing rounds, agent roles, and gate validations.
  - Persist debate transcripts linked to hypotheses and TMS sessions.
  - Establish safety guardrails, scoring rubric, and escalation paths for moderator intervention.
- **Visualization Layer v1**
  - Add timeline and graph components showing hypothesis confidence changes.
  - Surface gate/debate telemetry dashboards (admission rate, overrides, contention points).
  - Capture UX feedback checklist post-demo for iteration planning.

## Phase 5 (Week 7â€“8): Meta-Prompt Picker & Beta Hardening

### Goals
- Allow researchers to select prompt presets aligned with their objectives.
- Harden the system for limited Beta release with telemetry, safety, and documentation updates.

### Tasks
- **Meta-Prompt Picker**
  - Curate presets (Exploratory, Apologetic, Critical, Synthesis) with guardrail annotations.
  - Add UI controls to switch presets mid-session with validation warnings.
  - Track preset usage, satisfaction scores, and gate outcomes per preset.
- **Beta Hardening**
  - Run load tests for multi-hypothesis debate sessions; capture baseline metrics.
  - Expand adversarial test suite covering hallucination, citation drift, and prompt abuse.
  - Update onboarding documentation, create Beta feedback rubric, and finalize release checklist.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
pytest tests/domain/hypotheses/ -v
pytest tests/api/ai/test_gate.py -v
pytest tests/api/ai/test_pou_loop.py -v
pytest tests/api/ai/test_tms.py -v
pytest tests/api/ai/test_debate.py -v
```

### Integration & E2E
```bash
pytest tests/api/test_research_workflow.py -v
pytest tests/ui/test_hypothesis_workflow.py -v
npm run test:e2e:research --workspace theo/services/web
```

### Telemetry & Safety Checks
```bash
python scripts/telemetry/validate_gate_events.py
pytest tests/safety/test_prompt_guardrails.py -v
```

## Dependencies & Risks

- **Model Variance** â€“ Gate scoring depends on frontier models; capture calibration curves per provider.
- **Telemetry Overhead** â€“ New metrics streams may impact ingestion; batch writes and monitor latency.
- **Operator Training** â€“ Gate overrides and debate moderation require updated runbooks and demos.

---

## Communication Plan

- Weekly demo cadence showcasing gate decisions, TMS session replays, and debate transcripts.
- Async updates in `#theoria-research` summarizing gate metrics, hypothesis counts, and debate outcomes.
- Mid-cycle retrospective after Phase 3 to adjust scope for Beta hardening.
