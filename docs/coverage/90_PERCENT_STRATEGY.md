# 90% Coverage Strategy for Theoria

**Status:** Active Strategy  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Target:** 90% coverage for critical packages, 85% overall  

## Executive Summary

This strategy expands upon ADR 0003's baseline requirements:

- **80% overall coverage** (baseline requirement)
- **90% critical package coverage** (expanded enforcement)
- **85% overall coverage** (stretch goal)

Current state: **28.3% overall** with critical gaps in core infrastructure (0%), MCP (0%), and key business logic.

**Timeline assumes 50% team capacity** (2 developers half-time, parallel to feature development).

## Test Strategy by Coverage Level

### 0% ‚Üí 60%: Foundation Testing

**Focus: Basic functionality and happy paths**

```python
# Template for foundation tests
class TestCoreFunctionality:
    def test_basic_workflow(self):
        """Test primary use case works"""
        
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test appropriate exceptions raised"""
        
    def test_configuration_defaults(self):
        """Test default configurations"""
```

### 60% ‚Üí 80%: Comprehensive Testing

**Focus: Edge cases, integration, error scenarios**

```python
# Template for comprehensive tests
class TestComprehensiveCoverage:
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("scenario", ["case1", "case2", "edge"])
    def test_multiple_scenarios(self, scenario):
        """Test various input scenarios"""
        
    def test_integration_dependencies(self):
        """Test with real dependencies"""
        
    def test_performance_bounds(self):
        """Test performance constraints"""
```

### 80% ‚Üí 90%: Excellence Testing

**Focus: Branch coverage, mutation testing, security**

```python
# Template for excellence tests
class TestExcellenceCoverage:
    def test_all_branch_paths(self):
        """Test every conditional branch"""
        
    def test_security_boundaries(self):
        """Test security constraints"""
        
    def test_resource_exhaustion(self):
        """Test system limits and recovery"""
```

## Critical Package Test Plans

### `theo.services.api.app.core` (0% ‚Üí 90%)

**Files requiring coverage:**

- `database.py` - Connection lifecycle, transaction handling
- `settings.py` - Configuration validation, environment detection
- `runtime.py` - Runtime mode switching, feature flags
- `secret_migration.py` - Secret management, migration logic
- `settings_store.py` - Persistence, caching, updates
- `version.py` - Version information, compatibility checks

**Test Strategy:**

```python
# tests/api/core/test_comprehensive.py
class TestDatabaseExcellence:
    def test_connection_lifecycle_all_branches(self):
        """Test every connection state transition"""
        
    def test_transaction_commit_rollback_scenarios(self):
        """Test all transaction outcomes"""
        
    def test_pool_exhaustion_recovery(self):
        """Test connection pool limits"""

class TestSettingsExcellence:
    def test_all_environment_combinations(self):
        """Test every environment variable combination"""
        
    def test_validation_error_messages(self):
        """Test specific validation failures"""
```

### `theo.services.api.app.ingest` (16.2% ‚Üí 90%)

**Focus Areas:**

- Document parsing edge cases (malformed files, encodings)
- Large file handling (memory limits, streaming)
- Concurrent ingestion (race conditions, locking)
- Pipeline failures (recovery, partial states)
- Metadata enrichment (complex documents, edge cases)

## Automation & Tooling

### Coverage Enforcement

```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage.yml
- name: Verify Critical Coverage
  run: |
    python scripts/security/verify_critical_coverage.py
    # Enforces 90% for critical packages
    
- name: Overall Coverage Check
  run: |
    python -m pytest --cov=theo --cov-fail-under=80
    # Enforces 80% overall baseline
```

### Coverage Analysis Tools

```bash
# Enhanced coverage reporting
python analyze_coverage.py --detailed --branch-coverage

# Critical package verification
python scripts/security/verify_critical_coverage.py --strict

# Coverage trend analysis
python scripts/coverage/track_trends.py --weeks 12
```

### Dashboard Integration

- **Real-time coverage tracking** in `dashboard/coverage-dashboard.md`
- **Package-level heatmaps** for critical components
- **Trend analysis** with weekly progress reports
- **Automated alerts** for coverage regressions

---

## PR Coverage Policy

### During Implementation (Weeks 1-12)

**No Regression Policy:**

- **PRs cannot decrease coverage** for any package currently above its target
- **New code must maintain current coverage levels** in modified files
- **Critical packages require 90% coverage** for any new changes
- **Overall project coverage cannot drop** below 28.3% baseline

**Enforcement:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-coverage.yml
- name: PR Coverage Check
  run: |
    python scripts/coverage/pr_coverage_check.py
    # Blocks PRs that reduce coverage
```

**Exceptions:**

- Critical bug fixes may temporarily reduce coverage with explicit approval
- Infrastructure changes require compensating test coverage within 1 week
- New features must include tests to maintain overall coverage percentage

---

## Quality Gates

### CI/CD Integration

```python
# scripts/enforcement/coverage_gates.py
CRITICAL_THRESHOLDS = {
    "theo.services.api.app.core": 0.90,
    "theo.domain": 0.90,
    "theo.application": 0.90,
    "theo.services.api.app.ingest": 0.90,
    "theo.services.api.app.retriever": 0.90,
    "theo.services.api.app.ai.rag": 0.90,
}

OVERALL_THRESHOLD = 0.80  # Baseline from ADR 0003
STRETCH_THRESHOLD = 0.85  # Stretch goal
```

### Branch Protection Rules

- **PR must maintain 90% coverage** for modified critical packages
- **Overall coverage cannot decrease** below current baseline
- **New packages require 80% coverage** before merge
- **Critical bug fixes require comprehensive test coverage**
