# Security Incident Document watchlist configuration.
#
# Each entry defines the files that should trigger a SID review.
# When a pattern matches a changed file, at least one of the referenced
# `required_sids` or `sid_paths` must be updated in the same change.
#
# Example entry:
#
# entries:
#   - name: Authentication guardrails
#     description: Ensure the authentication SID stays current.
#     patterns:
#       - "theo/infrastructure/api/app/security.py"
#       - "theo/infrastructure/api/app/routes/auth/**"
#     required_sids:
#       - SID-XXXX
#     sid_paths:
#       - "docs/security/sids/authentication.md"
#
# Leave the list empty if there are no enforced watchlist rules yet.
