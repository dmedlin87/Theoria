## Governance Notes

- When creating a new feature doc, add it to this table with owner and review cadence.
- Update the `Last Reviewed` date whenever a doc gets meaningful edits.
- Status tags: `Planned`, `Active`, `Stable`, `Deprecated`.
- Review rotations should scan for `Last Reviewed` older than 30 days.
