# Psalm 82 and the Divine Council Motif

## Claim
Psalm 82 depicts Israel's God presiding over a council of lesser divine beings, highlighting both the uniqueness of Yahweh and the delegation of justice to subordinate elohim.

### Scope
- **Primary Passage:** Psalm 82
- **Related Passages:** Deuteronomy 32:8-9; Job 1–2; 1 Kings 22:19-23
- **Doctrinal Scope:** Angelology, divine council, monotheism
- **Confidence:** Moderate

## Evidence Summary
Ancient Near Eastern context and internal biblical parallels suggest Psalm 82 references a heavenly assembly under Yahweh's authority. The psalm's poetic structure and lexical features align with council language while ultimately affirming Yahweh's supremacy.

### Key Excerpts
- Psalm 82:1 — "God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment."
- Deuteronomy 32:8-9 — Nations are apportioned according to the "sons of God" while Yahweh claims Israel.
- 1 Kings 22:19 — Micaiah describes Yahweh seated among the host of heaven deliberating judgment.

| Michael S. Heiser, *The Divine Council in Late Canonical and Non-Canonical Second Temple Jewish Literature* | Dissertation | University of Wisconsin-Madison (2004) | Detailed study of divine council vocabulary and development |
| Patrick D. Miller, "Divine Council and Prophetic Call to Action" | Journal Article | *Harvard Theological Review* 96.1 (2003) | Connects council imagery to prophetic indictments |
| John H. Walton, *Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament* | Monograph | Baker Academic (2006) | Provides ANE background for council motifs |

## Analysis
- **Support Level:** The text strongly implies a celestial courtroom under Yahweh's authority, consistent with broader biblical usage.
- **Counterpoints:** Some argue "gods" refers to human judges; this view notes the psalm's focus on justice but struggles with the heavenly assembly setting in verse 1.
- **Risk Factors:** Overemphasizing polytheistic readings can obscure the psalm's climactic assertion of Yahweh's unrivaled sovereignty.

## Recommended Actions
1. Incorporate Psalm 82 into studies on biblical monotheism that allow for a tiered heavenly hierarchy under Yahweh.
2. Monitor scholarship on Second Temple interpretations of the divine council for emerging challenges to the traditional understanding.

## Appendices
### Literary Structure
Psalm 82 divides into three movements: (1) Yahweh convenes the council (v.1), (2) Yahweh indicts the unjust elohim (vv.2-7), (3) the psalmist petitions Yahweh to inherit all nations (v.8).

### Comparative ANE Parallels
Ugaritic texts (KTU 1.4) portray El presiding over an assembly of deities; Psalm 82 repurposes similar imagery to emphasize Yahweh's exclusive right to judge.
