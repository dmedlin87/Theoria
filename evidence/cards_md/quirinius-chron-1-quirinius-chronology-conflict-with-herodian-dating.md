# Quirinius chronology conflict with Herodian dating

**Claim:** Luke’s placement of Jesus’ birth with the census under Quirinius (6/7 CE) conflicts with Matthew’s placement under Herod the Great (d. 4 BCE).

**Scope:** Gospels/Nativity/Chronology  |  **Mode:** Skeptical  |  **Stability:** High  |  **Confidence:** 0.9

## Sources
**Primary**
- Luke 2:2
- Matthew 2:1, 19–22
- Josephus, Antiquities 17–18

**Secondary**
- Raymond E. Brown, The Birth of the Messiah (rev. ed.), pp. 547–571
- Jack Finegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology (rev. ed.), §§ 522–533
- Craig A. Evans & Stanley E. Porter (eds.), Dictionary of New Testament Background, “Quirinius”

## Quotes
> “This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.” (Luke 2:2, NRSV)

## Arguments For
- Josephus dates Quirinius’s census to 6/7 CE, after Archelaus’s ethnarchy was annexed.
- Herod the Great’s death is widely placed in 4 BCE; Matthew situates Jesus’ birth before that.
- Earlier Quirinian administration / alternative reading of ‘first’ remains speculative without solid epigraphic support.

## Counterpoints
- Minority proposals posit an earlier role for Quirinius or translation nuances in Luke 2:2; these remain debated.

## Open Questions
- Any new inscriptions supporting a pre-6 CE Quirinian census in Judea?
- How does Lukan theology of universal empire intersect with chronology choices?
